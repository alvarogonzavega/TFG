# TFG

This is my end of degree project. It consists in making a Unix shell with some improvements such as parallelization and the possibility to print wgraphs. It's in part based on a project I had in my second year in college. In that project my partners were @deEsteban (https://github.com/deesteban) and @s0f1a14 (https://github.com/s0f1a14)

# Getting started

Open your command line shell and type the following
```
git clone https://github.com/alvarogonzavega/TFG/src
Make
./wsh
```
